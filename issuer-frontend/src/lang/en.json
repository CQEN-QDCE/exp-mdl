The service exists to demonstrate the form of a digital credential of personal information a person might receive from a government such as the government of Quebec. Such a credential is a trusted, digital version containing the information commonly issued by governments on paper, such as a driver's license or passport. In a \"real\" version of an Issuer service, individuals would complete a verification process of who they are prior to the issuance of the digital credential to them, about them. The information in the credential would be sourced from the authority that holds that information. For more information about Digital Identity and Trust demonstrated with this service, see the Quebec Government Digital Foundations {link} (only French version). The credential generated from this service is only to be used with proof of concept, non-production credential Verifier services.",
