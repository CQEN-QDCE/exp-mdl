This service exists to demonstrate the form that could take a verifiable digital certificate of digital driving license, that a person might receive from a government, such as that of Quebec. This certificate is a reliable digital version that contains information generally issued by governments on a physical medium, such as a driving license or passport. In a \"real\" version of an issuing service, people would have to undergo an identity verification process before the digital certificate is issued to them. The information contained in the credential would be sourced from the authority that holds that information. For more information about Digital Identity and Trust demonstrated with this service, please consult the site of {link} (only French version).",

Any questions regarding this service or the project can be addressed via the {repoexpmdl}. Contributions to the project are also welcome!",
